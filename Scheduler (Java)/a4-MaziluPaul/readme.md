## Main purpose
The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate an understanding of:
- **OOP principles and layered architecture (UI â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Domain)**
- **Connecting JavaFX with SQL databases**
- **Data persistence, reporting, and stream processing in Java** 
- **Switching between repository types (in-memory, file-based, SQL, NoSQL)** via a configuration file   
- **Launching the app either via Command Line or GUI**, based on the settings file
