# 🩺 Doctor’s Office Scheduler — JavaFX Application with SQL Repository

## 💡 About the App

This application is a **scheduler for a doctor’s office**, designed to efficiently manage patients and their appointments.  
It allows adding, updating, deleting, and viewing appointments.


The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate an understanding of:
- **OOP principles and layered architecture (UI → Service → Repository → Domain)**
- **Connecting JavaFX with SQL databases**
- **Data persistence, reporting, and stream processing in Java**
- **Switching between repository types (in-memory, file-based, SQL, NoSQL)** via a configuration file  
- **Launching the app either via Command Line or GUI**, based on the settings file

✅ **Configurable Settings** – The app dynamically switches between repository types using the `settings.properties` file.  
✅ **JavaFX GUI** – A graphical interface complements the existing CLI version for better user interaction.  
✅ **Java Streams Reports** – Efficient data processing and reporting using Java 8 streams.  
✅ **Extendable Architecture** – Easily adaptable for NoSQL integration and future scalability.
