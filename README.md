Welcome to the repository that houses most of my journey through my university years.
Here, you can see the growth of my programming skills — from simple command-line programs all the way to full-stack applications.

I’ll give you a basic rundown of each project to save you some time (hopefully):

The Family Expenses App and Library projects are focused on OOP principles, understanding the basic MVC structure, learning about TDD, and parsing different types of files. All of this helped me build a solid grasp of programming fundamentals and become familiar with the language.

The Scheduler App was the first time I used JavaFX for the GUI and SQLite as a database for storing information instead of simple files. I also became more comfortable using IntelliJ IDEA and discovered some of the built-in features of the IDE.

Triathlon is where I connected the backend to the frontend and started to see how everything ties together. I also learned to work with APIs, understood the importance of DTOs, and gained experience in frontend programming with React.

While working on Workout_App, I learned more about frontend development and UI/UX design, focusing on writing code that is both readable and maintainable.
