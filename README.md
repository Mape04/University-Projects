## 🧭 Overview

I’d like to give you a quick rundown of each project to (hopefully) save you some time:

---

### 🧾 [Family Expenses App](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Family%20Expenses%20App%20(C%2B%2B)) & [Library](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Library%20(Python))

Focused on **OOP principles**, understanding the **MVC structure**, learning about **TDD**, and parsing different types of files.  
All of this helped me develop a solid grasp of programming fundamentals and become more confident with the language.

### 🗓️ [Scheduler App](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Scheduler%20(Java)/a4-MaziluPaul)

Marked the first time I used **JavaFX** for the GUI and **SQLite** as a database for storing information instead of simple files.  
During this project, I became more comfortable using **IntelliJ IDEA** and discovered several of the IDE’s built-in features.

### 🏊 [Triathlon](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Triathlon%20(Java%2C%20Client-Server))

This is where I connected the **backend** to the **frontend** and began to see how everything comes together.  
I also learned how to work with **APIs**, understood the importance of **DTOs**, and gained hands-on experience in frontend programming with **React**.

### 💪 [Workout_App](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Workout_App%20(Java))

While working on **Workout_App**, I deepened my understanding of **frontend development** and **UI/UX design**,  
focusing on writing code that is both readable and maintainable.
