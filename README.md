### 🧾 [Family Expenses App](https://github.com/Mape04/University-Projects/tree/main/Family%20Expenses%20App%20(C%2B%2B)) & Library

Focused on **OOP principles**, understanding the **MVC structure**, learning about **TDD**, and parsing different types of files.  
All of this helped me develop a solid grasp of programming fundamentals and become more confident with the language.
